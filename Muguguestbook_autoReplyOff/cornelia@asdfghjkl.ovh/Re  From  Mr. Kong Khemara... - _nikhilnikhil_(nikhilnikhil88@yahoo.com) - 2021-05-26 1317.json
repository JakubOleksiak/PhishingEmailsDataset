Administrator.</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\n&nbsp;</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nWe're the Financial Intelligence Organization, an arm of the US</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nTreasury Department. We are in contact with you because an unclaimed</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nmoney in your name is in the wrong hand down there in Africa-Nigeria.</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nIn compliance with the new financial laws (as amended from Subsection</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\n314(a) of the USA FINANCIAL Act of 2001) and screening procedures</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nfacilitated by the US federal law enforcement agencies to checkmate</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nall financial institution, we are dedicated to reuniting individuals</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nwith their lost and forgotten money. It will interest you to know we</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nwork closely with the government in obtaining the most up-to-date</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\ninformation for unclaimed money. We utilize extremely accurate</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\ncomprehensive data resources that enable us to connect lost and</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nforgotten money with its rightful owner: YOU!</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\n&nbsp;</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nOn a good note, we have been able to detect unscrupulous and unlawful</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nmovement of funds- in any of forms: tax&nbsp; refunds, proceeds earned from</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\ndiversified portfolio, overseas derivative (investment) and inheritance</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nfunds through our network of financial organizations. With the aid of</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nglobal tracking technology, we were able to trace this funds through</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nlocal and foreign financial centers- both in Africa and worldwide.</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nFair enough, we have recently installed a Computer Assisted Inspection</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nin all bank's database, to help us detect fraud in the line with funds</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nmovement at a glance!</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\n&nbsp;</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nThe above statement is the reason for the US Money Regulatory Agency's</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nInvolvement in this. In this Internet age, privileged information</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\noften get to the wrong users. For instance, phishing attacks</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nperpetrated by online hackers and crackers. One of our major</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nobjectives and measures we have embarked upon, apart from making sure</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nthat individuals receive their due claim, is to redress the financial</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nirregularities, ills, and reduce the proliferation of scam preyed on</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nthe citizens of United</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nStates!</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\n&nbsp;</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nFollowing the recent verdict passed by a federal judge in Manhattan,</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nit is resolved that all beneficiary receive their funds direct through</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nour accredited financial agent- no longer by intermediary banks,</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\neither local or foreign! This is better to forestall discipline in the</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nnormal</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nbanking ethics, and rule out unnecessary red-tape among financial</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nauthorities, and ensure standard bank practice are observed to</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\neveryone's benefit.</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\n&nbsp;</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nTo this end, we have issued a \"stop order\" to an impending transfer to</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nYour family as opposed to the details on the transfer account. In</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\norder to reconcile this transfer, we need you to confirm if you or any</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nof your family member has authorized your funds to this account below</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\n(and this</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nname?).</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\n&nbsp;</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nAccount Holder's Name: Steven Parkett John</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nResidential Address: 1672 Fife Way,</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nSan Jose, CA 95132</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nBank Accout #: 006108970</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nRouting #: 322271627- WMSBUS66</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\nBank Name: CHASE/WAMU</DIV>\r\n<DIV>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1289 S.
