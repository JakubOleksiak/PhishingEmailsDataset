I am Mrs. Jessica Becker, from\r\nIndonesia. I was married to the former British ambassador to Burkina\r\nFaso for nine years before he died in 2004. We had one child who died\r\nearlier before his late father.\r\n\r\nMy late husband deposited the sum of $5.5MUSD Five million five\r\nhundred thousand dollars in a bank when he was alive. Recently, my\r\ndoctor told me that my days are numbered and I would not last 4 months\r\ndue to Breast cancer and kidney failure problems. Having known my\r\ncondition I decided to donate this fund to you for charity. I want you\r\nto use this fund for orphanages, widows and the needy in the society.\r\n\r\nI am not afraid of death because I lived a fulfilled life. I do not\r\nneed any telephone communication in this regard because of my health.\r\n\r\nHope to receive your response contact me with this email for more\r\ndetail: jessicabecker708@gmail.com\r\n\r\nThanks and remain blessed.Yours sister.\r\n\r\nMrs Jessica Becker\r\n",
