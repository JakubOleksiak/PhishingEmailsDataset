I also want you to know that, this may \r\ncause me my job if words get out that I gave this information \r\nout. So for this I need somebody that I can trust. My name is \r\nMarsh Arce, head of luggage/baggage storage facilities \r\n(Operations, Maintenance, Transportation) at Los Angeles \r\nInternational Airport - L.A.X,USA. During my recent withheld \r\npackage routine check at the Airport Storage Vault last year  \r\nDecember 2020, I discovered an abandoned shipment from a Diplomat \r\nfrom Australia and when scanned, it revealed an undisclosed sum \r\nof money in a Metal Trunk Box weighing approximately 320kg. The \r\nconsignment was abandoned because the Contents of the consignment \r\nwas not properly declared by the consignee as \"MONEY\" rather it \r\nwas declared as personal effect to avoid interrogation and also \r\nthe inability of the diplomat to pay for the United States Non \r\nInspection Charges \r\nof $5,700.00.\r\n\r\nThe trunk has since been deposited with a bank after report \r\nconfirmed, the death of the diplomat, whom report says, he died \r\nfrom Covid-19 complications. So the reason I am contacting you, \r\nis for you to work with me and act as his next of  kin, because \r\nyou both share the same last name. I will go ahead and pay for\r\nthe United States Non Inspection Fee of $5,700.00 and arrange for \r\nyou, documents in which you will present to the bank. On \r\ncompletion, the bank will hand over all the money to you by \r\ntransferring it to your bank account but you have to assure me, \r\nonce you receive the funds, it will be share equaly.\r\n\r\nI wait to hear from you urgently and I will appreciate if we can \r\nkeep this deal strictly confidential. You might think of it as \r\nillegal but it's not as if no one comes to make claim of it, the \r\ngovernment will claim it after 2yrs, so it's not illegal.\r\n\r\nplease get back to me via my private Email: \r\n(babeyzsweety@gmail.com) for further directives.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n \r\n\r\nMarsh Arce\r\n",
