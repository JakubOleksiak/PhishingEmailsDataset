This was done because of the\r\nautocracy from the CBN where\r\nthey use beneficiary money to make interest from deposits with local banks\r\nfor a short period of time. This has frustrated so many fund beneficiaries\r\nand also caused several delays from getting foreign beneficiaries paid\r\ntheir due sum.\r\n\r\nBut with the intervention of the Presidency giving the Union Bank of\r\nNigeria the unanimous right to handle all foreign payment under the\r\nsupervision of the CBN.  As the case maybe, the CBN has declared the sum of\r\nUS$5.1M as your accrued interest and also approved this sum to be paid to\r\nyou without any further delay. It is my duty to verify your information and\r\nalso ensure that the said amount is immediately allocated for payment.\r\n\r\nNB: KINDLY GET BACK TO ME WITH YOUR FULL BANKING DETAILS FOR THE TRANSFER\r\nOF YOUR FUNDS, INCLUDING YOUR ADDRESS, TELEPHONE NUMBER, OCCUPATION, AGE\r\nAND COPY OF YOUR IDENTIFICATION.\r\n\r\nwe have allocated to you new International Payment Voucher Number:\r\nIMF/FRBWDC/US-BG-93WB82UN567-G, Approval Number: 7402-2011,\r\nCertificate of Merit Number: 781 and Release Code Number: 0295 and you must\r\nquote any of these Identification Numbers\r\nbefore us for proper identification. Note also that your file is\r\ncurrently in my office  and from the records I have in my file, you have\r\nbeen cleared to receive the sum of US$5.1M only.\r\n\r\nNOTE; REPLY DIRECT TO THIS EMAIL ; REPLY EMAIL; carrdr.teven@gmail.com\r\n\r\nCONGRATULATIONS IN ADVANCE .\r\n\r\nBEST REGARDS,\r\nMR EMEKA EMUWA.\r\nDirector, Foreign Operations\r\n{UNION BANK PLC}\r\nEMAIL:carrdr.teven@gmail.com\r\n",
