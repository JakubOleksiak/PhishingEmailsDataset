Box 5216,\r\n LAGOS- NIGERIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nDear  :\r\n\r\nThis letter is written to you in order to change your life\r\nfrom today. I am Mr.John Aboh the Director, International\r\nRemittance Department of this Bank, my Boss, Mr. Jacobs\r\nM.Ajekigbe, the Managing Director/CEO of this bank is now on\r\ncompulsory leave and all power have been vested on me to\r\nmake all international payments.\r\nAlso, due to reported cases of corrupt practices in other\r\nNigeria Banks including the Central Bank of Nigeria, the\r\nFederal Government has revoked/cancelled all power vested on\r\n those banks and has appointed our bank (First Bank of\r\nNigeria) to make all foreign payments.\r\n\r\nBe informed that the Federal Government have approved the\r\nrelease of part-payment of $7.5M(Seven Millon Five Hundred\r\nThousand Dollars) out of your total funds, which has been in\r\nthis bank for many years unclaimed because my boss Mr.\r\nJacobs Ajekigbe, collaboration with the Governor of Central\r\nBank of Nigeria (CBN) have refused to tell you the truth on\r\nhow to claim your fund this is because he has been using the\r\ninterest accumulated from your fund every year to enrich\r\nhimself without your knowledge.\r\n\r\nI want to help you pull out this fund to your bank account\r\nusing the easiest and the quickest method, which have not\r\nbeen made known to you before. By this method, you will open\r\na domiciliary account with this bank (First Bank of\r\nNigeria), your fund would be lodged into this domiciliary\r\naccount and your fund will be paid in directly to any bank\r\nof your choice. After the transfer, you will confirm the\r\nfund in your bank account within 5hours the same day. No\r\nCost of Transfer (COT) and no stoppage from any Government\r\ndepartments as the\r\ntransfer will be done within the bank alone and it is very\r\nsafe.\r\n\r\nThe method which was introduced to you before is the\r\nTelegraphic Transfer (TT) for which confirmation was 48hrs,\r\nbecause of the time factor, petitions could come from\r\narious organizations stopping your payment and asking you\r\nto pay huge fee which would be difficult for you to pay so\r\nthat they can benefit from the huge interest your fund\r\ngenerates while still in the Bank.\r\n\r\nThis method is not safe for you because it is not done\r\nwithin the bank alone as information of the payment would be\r\nsent to the Central Control Unit (CCU) of the Federal\r\nMinistry of Finance and office of the Accountant General of\r\nthe Federation.\r\n\r\nAs a good Christian, I have nothing to gain by keeping your\r\nfund, I want to assist you receive your fund before my boss\r\nresumes office. You have to follow up and work with me now,\r\nso keep this very confidential because of fraudsters and\r\nimpostors who go about presenting various bank accounts in\r\norder to divert another beneficiary's fund.\r\n\r\nyour present/valid account co-ordinates and amount to be\r\n claimed so that I do not transfer your fund to the wrong\r\n Bank Account Awaiting your quick response.\r\n\r\n\r\n Yours truly,\r\n Mr. John Aboh\r\n",
