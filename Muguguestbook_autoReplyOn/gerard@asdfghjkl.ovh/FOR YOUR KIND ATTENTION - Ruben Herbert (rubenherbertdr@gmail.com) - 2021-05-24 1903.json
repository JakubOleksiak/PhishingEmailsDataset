I recently became infested with the Covid-19 virus and due to\r\nmy age, I don't think I can survive this, I have been under oxygen for a\r\nfew days and I can't buy my life with the money I could donate to charity,\r\nespecially in my homeland, Poland to help the poor. Last year, I lost my\r\nwife to cancer, and my only son is a chronic gambler and squandered all the\r\nfunds I gave him. Lying on the sick bed, with no hope of survival, I wish\r\nyou helped me fulfill my last wish. Hope this is a wish that will serve me\r\nas a plea to God for my soul and my forgiveness of sins. If you are willing\r\nand ready to help me, please answer me and I may give you details. I know I\r\ncan trust you, help me as a brother.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nRuben Herbert\r\n",
