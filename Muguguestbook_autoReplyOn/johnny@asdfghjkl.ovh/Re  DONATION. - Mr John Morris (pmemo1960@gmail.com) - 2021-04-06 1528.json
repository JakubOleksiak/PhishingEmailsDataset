I have some\r\n\r\nmoney and property which worth about EUR 650,000.00\r\n\r\nI wish to donate this money & property to an honest and a good hearted\r\nPerson, who can help people at this difficult\r\n\r\nperiod of COVID 19, especially orphans, widows, physically challenged\r\npeople, elderly and children in difficult\r\n\r\nsituations.\r\n\r\nThis Donation is a gift, and I will be happy, if you can manage this fund\r\nwell with the fear of the Lord to make sure\r\n\r\nthat it serves the less privileged people around your community, especially\r\norphans and widows.\r\n\r\nIt is really sad to tell you that I have lost My two brothers in Italy and\r\nMy cousin in Spain and my two  close\r\n\r\nfriends  in Serbia and Croatia through this dangerous pandemic (COVID-19).\r\n\r\nHope to read from you in order to advise further. Attached with this\r\nmessage is a copy of my passport for your file.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nMr Neil Trotter\r\nEmail: d.neiltrotter@yahoo.com\r\n",
