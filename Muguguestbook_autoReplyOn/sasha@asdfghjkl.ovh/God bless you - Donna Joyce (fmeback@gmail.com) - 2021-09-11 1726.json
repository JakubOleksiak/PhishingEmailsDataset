You can make a change in the life of others,most\r\nespecially the poor at heart , and the less privileged. first. I think\r\ni would start all with a proper introduction of myself...I am Mrs\r\nJoyce Donna, a widow to Late Anderson Donna. I am 67 years\r\nold,suffering from long time cancer of the breast .\r\n\r\nFrom all indications , my condition is really deteriorating and is\r\nquite obvious that I may not live more than four months after my next\r\nsurgery , because the cancer stage has gotten to a very severe stage .\r\nMy personal physician told me that I may not live for more than 2\r\nmonths and I am so scared about it . I have no child of mine , even\r\nthough i wish i had . It is late now you know , since i can not get\r\nmarried again , and age is no longer on my side.Psalms 119:116 Uphold\r\nme according unto thy word, that I may live, and let me not ashamed of\r\nmy hope.Psalms 138: 7 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou will\r\nrevive me......Psalms 145:18 Psalms 57: 7 My heart is fixed. O God my\r\nheart is fixed, I will sing & give praise Psalms 51: 17 The sacrifices\r\nof God are broken spirit, a broken & contrite heart, O God thou will\r\nnot despise.\r\npsalms 41: 1 Blessed is he that considerate the poor, the Lord will\r\ndeliver him in time of trouble.Two of my favorite verses:\r\nPhilippians2:27: For indeed he was sick nigh unto death, but God had\r\nmercy on him & that on him only, but on me also,lest I should have\r\nsorrow upon sorrow.( I always say this in my mind)\r\n\r\nSo, I now decide to divide part of my wealth, by contributing to the\r\ndevelopment of the motherless baby homes, needy, poor, charity homes\r\nand widows too.i am willing to donate the huge sum of $5million USD\r\nwhich is still the major inheritance i have left.i wish you could be\r\nsomeone who i could trust with all my heart,to make this wish of mine\r\ncome true...Please note that, this fund is lying in a Bank. so i need\r\nyou to use the funds to help the poor . I know this is hard , and it\r\ntake a very strong heart to get this done , but you should keep this\r\nsaying in your heart , I am like Moses in the Bible . He came to the\r\nRed Sea and Pharaoh behind him and no way to turn but God delivered\r\nhim all by a miraculous deliverance . It will be a miracle from God to\r\nbe able to help all the dear people God has laid on our hearts .\r\n\r\n  This is why with God in my heart,i contact you,and i want you to\r\ncontact me,so we be in contact with all the poor souls out there .\r\nGive new lives , hopes and days . I have come to find out that wealth\r\nacquisition without Christ is vanity and i hope you will agree with\r\nthis also . I will be praying hard that Satan will not stop this\r\neffort .do get back to me and i will tell you more of what you wish to\r\nknow .\r\n\r\nI await your response\r\nGod bless you\r\nMrs Joyce Donna\r\n",
