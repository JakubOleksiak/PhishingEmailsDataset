DAVID ELLIS,\r\nHEAD OF INSPECTION UNIT\r\nUNITED NATIONS INSPECTION AGENCY\r\nHARTS FIELD-JACKSON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT.\r\nATLANTA , GEORGIA\r\n\r\n\r\nI am David Ellis Head of Inspection Unit United Nations Inspection\r\nAgency in Harts field-Jackson International Airport Atlanta, Georgia.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring our investigation, I discovered An abandoned shipment through a\r\nDiplomat from United Kingdom which was transferred from JF Kennedy\r\nAirport To our facility here in Atlanta, and when scanned it revealed\r\nan undisclosed sum of money in 2 Metal Trunk Boxes weighing\r\napproximately 110kg each.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe consignment was abandoned because the Content was not properly\r\ndeclared by the consignee as money rather it was declared as personal\r\nEffect/classified document to either avoid diversion by the Shipping\r\nAgent or confiscation by the relevant authorities. The diplomat's\r\ninability to pay for Non Inspection fees among other things are the\r\nreason why the consignment is delayed and abandoned.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy my assessment, each of the boxes contains about $4M or more.They\r\nare still left in the airport storage facility till today. The\r\nConsignments like I said are two metal trunk boxes weighing about\r\n110kg each (Internal dimension: W61 x H156 x D73 (cm) effective\r\nCapacity: 680 L) Approximately. The details of the consignment\r\nincluding your name and email on the official document from United\r\nNations' office in London where the shipment was tagged as personal\r\neffects/classified document is still available with us. As it stands\r\nnow, you have to reconfirm your Full name, Phone Number, full address\r\nso I can cross-check and see if it corresponds with the one on the\r\nofficial documents. It is now left to you to decide if you still need\r\nthe consignment or allow us repatriate it back to UK (place of origin)\r\nas we were instructed.\r\n\r\n\r\nLike I did say again, the shipper abandoned it and ran away most\r\nimportantly because he gave a false declaration, he could not pay\r\nforthe yellow tag, he could not secure a valid non inspection\r\ndocument(s), etc. I am ready to assist you in any way I can for you to\r\nget back this packages provided you will also give me something out of\r\nit (financial gratification). You\r\ncan either come in person, or you engage the services of a secure\r\nshipping/delivery\r\n\r\n\r\nCompany/agent that will provide the necessary security That is\r\nrequired to deliver the package to your doorstep or the destination of\r\nyour choice. I need all the guarantee that I can get from you before I\r\ncan get involved in this project.
