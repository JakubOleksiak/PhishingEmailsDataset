Kennedy International airport, New York- working hand in hand\r\nwith the Department of Homeland Security and U.S Customs and Border\r\nProtection.\r\n\r\nDuring our investigation, I discovered an abandoned shipment from a\r\nDiplomat from Africa and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of\r\nmoney in a metal trunk box weighing approximately 25kg each.\r\n\r\nThe consignment was abandoned because the Content was not properly declared\r\nby the consignee as money rather it was declared as personal effect to\r\navoid diversion by the shipping agent and also the Diplomat inability to\r\npay for\r\nNon Inspection Fees.\r\n\r\nOn my assumption, each of the boxes will contain about $3 Million to $4\r\nMillion each and the consignment is still left in the storage house till\r\ntoday. The consignment are two metal boxes with weight of about 25kg each\r\n(Internal dimension: W61 x H156 x D73 (cm). Effective capacity: 110 LBS.).\r\nApproximately, the details of the consignment including your name and\r\naddress, the official document from the United Nation office in Africa are\r\ntagged on the Metal Trunk boxes.\r\n\r\nPROVIDE YOUR NAME, PHONE NUMBER FULL HOME ADDRESS\r\nAND NEAREST AIRPORT AROUND YOUR CITY.\r\n\r\nYou can send the required details to me by email for onward delivery. All\r\ncommunication must be held extremely confidential. I can get everything\r\nconcluded within 5-6 hours upon your acceptance and proceed to your address\r\nfor delivery if you assure me of sharing the content 30% for me/70% with\r\nyou on my arrival to your house.\r\n\r\nI want us to transact this business with you and share the money, since the\r\nshipper has abandoned it and disappeared. I will pay for the Non inspection\r\nfee and arrange for the boxes to be moved out of this airport to your\r\naddress by myself. But I will share it 30%/70% with you.\r\n\r\nBelow is my direct telephone number (408) 990-3853. Call me as soon as you\r\nreceive this mail and send me all the requested information to my email.\r\n\r\nBest Regards.\r\n\r\nDAVID CARL LEE\r\nINSPECTION UNIT\r\n(408) 990-3853\r\n",
