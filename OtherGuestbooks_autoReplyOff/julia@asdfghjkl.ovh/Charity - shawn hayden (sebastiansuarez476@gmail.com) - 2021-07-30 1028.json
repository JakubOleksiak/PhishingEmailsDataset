I recently became infected with the Covid-19 virus and due to\r\nmy age, I don't think I can survive this. I have been under oxygen for a\r\nfew days and I can't buy my life with money. I could donate 55million\r\nUSD to charity,\r\nespecially to help the poor. Last year I lost my wife to cancer and my\r\nonly son is a chronic\r\ngambler who squandered all the funds I gave to him.\r\nLying in my sick bed, with no hope of survival, I wish\r\nyou helped me fulfill my last wish. This is a wish that will serve me\r\nas a plea to God for my soul and my forgiveness of sins. If you are willing\r\nand ready to help, please answer me and I will give you details. I know I\r\ncan trust you. Help me please.\r\n\r\nKind regards.\r\n\r\nShawn Hayden.\r\n",
