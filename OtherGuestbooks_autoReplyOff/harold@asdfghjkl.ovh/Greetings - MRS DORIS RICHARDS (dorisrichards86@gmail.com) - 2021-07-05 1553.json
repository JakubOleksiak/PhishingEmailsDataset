I bring peace and love to you. It is by\r\nthe grace of god, I had no choice than to do what is lawful and right in\r\nthe sight of God for eternal life and in the sight of man for witness of\r\ngod\u2019s mercy and glory upon my life. My dear, I sent this mail praying it\r\nwill find you in a good condition, since I myself am in a very critical\r\nhealth condition in which I sleep every night without knowing if I may be\r\nalive to see the next day. I am Mrs.Doris Richard, a widow suffering from a\r\nlong time illness. I have some funds I inherited from my late husband, the\r\nsum of ($11,000,000.00, Eleven Million Dollars) my Doctor told me recently\r\nthat I have serious sickness which is a cancer problem. What disturbs me\r\nmost is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition, I decided to donate\r\nthis fund to a good person that will utilize it the way I am going to\r\ninstruct herein. I need a very honest and God fearing person who can claim\r\nthis money and use it for Charity works, for orphanages and gives justice\r\nand help to the poor, needy and widows says The Lord.\" Jeremiah 22:15-16.\u201c\r\nand also build schools for less privilege that will be named after my late\r\nhusband if possible and to promote the word of god and the effort that the\r\nhouse of god is maintained.   I do not want a situation where this money\r\nwill be used in an ungodly manner. That's why I'm taking this decision. I'm\r\nnot afraid of death, so I know where I'm going. I accept this decision\r\nbecause I do not have any child who will inherit this money after I die.\r\nPlease I want your sincere and urgent answer to know if you will be able to\r\nexecute this project, and I will give you more information on how the fund\r\nwill be transferred to your bank account. May the grace, peace, love and\r\nthe truth in the Word of god be with you and all those that you love and\r\ncare for.  I am waiting for your reply.  May God Bless you,*\r\n\r\n* Mrs. Doris Richards.*\r\n",
