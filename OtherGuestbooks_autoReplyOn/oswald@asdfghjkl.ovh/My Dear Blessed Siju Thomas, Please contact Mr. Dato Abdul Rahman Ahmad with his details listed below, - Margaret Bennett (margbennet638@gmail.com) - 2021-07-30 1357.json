I am writing you this\r\nmessage from my Heart and I want you to know that before I contacted you, I\r\nhave prayed And Fasted to God almighty for him to Lead me to the rightfully\r\nperson that will Help me fulfill my last Wishes on earth and I believe he\r\nhas directed me to you. I have been serving God before I developed this\r\nsickness, and I was asked to go back to my country for better treatment.\r\nBut it has not been easy for me to carry things as I plan them due to my\r\nHealth most especially now that This Cancer has spread all over my Body. I\r\nfound it very difficult to accomplish My Mission on earth before I go back\r\nto meet my God in Heaven.\r\n\r\nMore so, have it in mind that I am alone in the hospital and ever since I\r\nwas brought back from Malaysia to Scotland, everybody that claimed to be my\r\nwell-wishers has departed from me simply because when they all heard the\r\nCancer has affected my Whole body and my late husband relatives Also denied\r\nme as well because I was not able to bear any child for my late husband\r\nafter the death of our only child that is why I am finding it too hard to\r\naccomplish my mission here on earth and I hope my trust and believing in\r\nyou won't be in vain.\r\n\r\nMy late husband's relatives are wishing me death because all they are\r\nConcerned about is my late husband's wealth. They want me to die so that\r\nthey can Be able to claim all that my late husband left behind before He\r\ndied, Simply because I had no child for my late Husband and they Called me\r\nall sort of names, Like (BARREN WOMEN), they even said that killed my\r\nhusband but only God can bear me witness because God knows I cannot kill. I\r\nwant you to claim this fund and use it to help the Poor and less privileged\r\nin your country. Instead of my late husband Relatives to access to this\r\nfund I would rather hand it over to you to take Care of the fund and also\r\nhelp people who desire help. Because if This Fund gets to my late husband's\r\nrelatives, they will misuse the fund. I am doing this because the doctor\r\ntold me that I would not live for long after my surgery, so I decided to\r\nuse this fund to help the poor.\r\n\r\nI have received several messages from the *CIMB Bank Berhad Malaysia* for\r\nme to send someone I can entrust My funds to, before my operation commence\r\nand since everybody around me is just After my downfall and how they can\r\nget my funds and use it for worldly purpose I have Decided to pray to God\r\nAlmighty for him to help me choose one of his faithful servant To assist me\r\nin fulfilling my last wishes. Please I really need your trust and mercy\r\nbecause I am entrusting you with all my suffering and pains and it will be\r\na great pleasure if you can help me fulfill my wish to the very end. I\r\nbelieve God almighty will see me through my operation which is coming up\r\nnext two week to enable me to see you person to person in the future and I\r\nwill be very glad if you keep me in prayers.\r\n\r\nThe Director of the Bank who is my account officer also mailed me and asked\r\nme to look for a relation which I trust with my heart to claim my funds\r\nbefore the Malaysia Government claim's it as an unclaimed fund. I don't\r\nhave anybody to call my relatives because my late husband Relative, whom I\r\nwas supposed to depend on, has turned their back on me, and this fund is in\r\nfixed deposit. I don't want the government to claim my fund. That is why I\r\nwant to use the fund to help the less privileged and poor people in your\r\ncountry through you.\r\n\r\nBelow are my bank details which I want you to use to contact my bank after\r\nreading this message.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**BANK NAME: CIMB BANK BERHAD MALAYSIA*CONTACT PERSON: MR.
