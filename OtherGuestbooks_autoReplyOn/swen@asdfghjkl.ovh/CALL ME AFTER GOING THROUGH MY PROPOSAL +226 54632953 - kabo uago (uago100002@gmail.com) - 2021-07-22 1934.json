I decided to contact you after a careful thought that\r\nyou may be capable of handling this business transaction which I\r\nexplained below;\r\n\r\nIn my department, I discovered an abandoned sum of $13.5m US dollars\r\n(Thirteen million, five hundred thousand US dollars). In an account\r\nthat belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his\r\nentire family in 2007 in a plane crash.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince i got information about his death, The bank have been expecting\r\nhis next of kin to come over and claim his money because The fund\r\ncannot be released unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or\r\nrelation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but\r\nunfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin(his son and wife)\r\ndied alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for\r\nthe claim .It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to\r\nmake this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the\r\nnext of kin (I want to present you as his business associate )to the\r\ndeceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming\r\nfor it and I don't want this money to go into the Bank treasury as\r\nunclaimed Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money\r\nremained Unclaimed after twelve years, the money will be transferred\r\nto another foreigner . The request of foreigner as next of kin in this\r\nbusiness is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner\r\nand a Burkina be cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI agree that 40% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in\r\nrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside\r\nfor expenses incurred during the business and 50% would be for me .\r\nThere after I will visit your country for disbursement according to\r\nthe percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer\r\nof this fund to your account as arranged, you must apply first to the\r\nbank as next of kin of the deceased customer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the\r\ntext of the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that\r\nthis transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any\r\natom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the\r\ntransfer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI expect that you contact me immediately as soon as you receive this\r\nletter, and send me your personal data including your scan copy of\r\nyour identification for details and continuation of this transaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHoping to hear from you immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYours faithfully,\r\n\r\nMr.Kabo Uago\r\n",
