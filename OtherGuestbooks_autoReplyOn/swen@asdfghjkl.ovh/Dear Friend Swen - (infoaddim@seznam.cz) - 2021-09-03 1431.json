Before proceeding let me briefly\u00a0introduce myself once more, I\r\n am Kenneth Harry the branch manager of\u00a0the National bank here in Montreal \r\n Quebec Canada, I got your contact\u00a0through the internet\u00a0directory while \r\n looking for people with the same last name as my late\u00a0client Albert\u00a0Swen\u00a0\r\n This search for Albert heir has taken several\u00a0months and has got me \r\n exhausted, but I attach a lot of importance to\u00a0it. So please every \r\n information I send to you is privileged and you\u00a0have to keep it to \r\n yourself. Across this country we have about $8.6\u00a0billion unclaimed money \r\n sitting in banks and Albert\u2019s money is part of\u00a0it because there has been no\r\n owner-directed activity on this money\u00a0since his death.\r\n\r\n \r\n As his account officer I am in this search for his next of kin because\u00a0it \r\n has been many years since Albert\u2019s death and the statue\u00a0 of\u00a0limitations for\r\n claiming the money will expire soon if no one claims\u00a0this fund as the law \r\n of this country states. Albert was our customer\u00a0for almost (10) ten years \r\n before his death. I will like to stop my\u00a0search for Albert\u2019s family members\r\n with you as his closest living\u00a0relative. The money concerned is a big \r\n amount and having spent a lot\u00a0of time and money in the long search; I want \r\n to stop from further\u00a0incurring the costs. I believe that we can reclaim his\r\n money and make\u00a0judicious use of it. My shortcoming is that I cannot make\u00a0 \r\n the claim\u00a0myself without presenting someone who shares the same family name\r\n with\r\n Albert. To claim it doesn't necessarily require you to be a close\u00a0member of\r\n his family. As I have the original certificate of deposit\u00a0with me, I can \r\n present you to the financial institution to claim the\u00a0fund since I still \r\n have 90 days to present the beneficiary and next of\u00a0kin to the bank before \r\n the time the financial institution gave me\u00a0expires and the money goes to \r\n our government.\r\n \r\n \u00a0Normally I am supposed to go for a fee for tracking you down, but for\u00a0the \r\n basis of interest, I want us to quietly claim this money\u00a0 and make\u00a0good use\r\n of it on equal basis, as long as you will not betray my\u00a0effort after \r\n working for it to be released to you. The release will be\u00a0made within the \r\n law of this country and your own country. To\u00a0proceed with the application, \r\n I will use your name/credentials and\u00a0link it to Albert\u2019s SURNAME and \r\n present to the bank, then you will be\u00a0required to write an official letter \r\n to the bank informing the bank\u00a0that you are aware that your late Family \r\n Member Mr. Albert\u00a0Swen\u00a0left the sum of (US$17, 500,000,00) in our bank for \r\n self-keeping which\u00a0he made you next of kin, that you are requesting the \r\n bank to notify\u00a0you of any requirements for immediate transfer of your \r\n inheritance to\u00a0your designated bank account, if they respond and approve \r\n the claim\u00a0the money will be shared appropriately between you and me. But if\r\n the\u00a0application is rejected there is no legal implication other than to\u00a0\r\n leave the claim and the fund goes to the government.\r\n\r\n \r\n You can be assured that the application will not be rejected as I know\u00a0\r\n everything about the account hence I am very certain that the funds\u00a0will be\r\n released to you once we apply. With all I have explained, and\u00a0as someone in\r\n the banking field, applying for this money does not mean\u00a0that the financial\r\n institution will release it automatically, You will\u00a0be required to provide \r\n them with legal paperwork which we will be\u00a0using a lawyer to acquire on \r\n your behalf; my only advice to you is to\u00a0keep it strictly private between \r\n the two of us until we have\u00a0the money in our possession.\r\n \r\n \u00a0As soon as the bank approves the application I will let you know how\u00a0we \r\n will continue. However, I need a mail from you indicating your\u00a0acceptance \r\n to do this with me and also pledge that you shall abide by\u00a0our sharing \r\n understanding. The total amount involved is US$17, 500,\u00a0000,00 (Seventeen \r\n Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars\u00a0Only). I have decided \r\n the following\r\n \r\n Sharing method as follows:\r\n \r\n \u00a01. 45% will be for me\r\n \r\n 2. 45% will go for you\r\n \r\n 3 10% for charity purposes\r\n \r\n 4. We both will also share the eventual expenses that we might incur\u00a0during\r\n  the course of approval and moving the funds to your designated\u00a0bank \r\n account as it is practically impossible to claim inheritance\u00a0without \r\n expenses. If you are OK with these sharing ratio/modalities,\u00a0let me know as\r\n soon as possible through email or phone indicating your\u00a0acceptance so we \r\n can proceed.\r\n \r\n Upon your positive response I shall be sending you my personal\u00a0\r\n identification and shall draft\u00a0 an MOU before we proceed with the\u00a0\r\n execution. You can reach me on my private number 1 514 448 2414 for\u00a0more \r\n briefing if need be.\r\n \r\n Regards\r\n Kenneth Harry\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n Hello,\r\n how can I help you with this?\r\n \r\n Sincerely\r\n Swen\r\n\t\r\n",
