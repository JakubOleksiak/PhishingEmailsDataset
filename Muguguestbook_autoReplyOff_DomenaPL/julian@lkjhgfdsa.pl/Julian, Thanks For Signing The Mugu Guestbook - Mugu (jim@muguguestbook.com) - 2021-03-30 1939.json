Sorry, this site does not send them out so I have no idea. I've heard that people start getting them within hours sometimes but it depends on how diligent our esteemed friends are feeling today. Anyway, if you're asking this question then I understand your eagerness to get started but you're in the wrong frame of mind. When entering into these transactions you will be constantly pestered, hassled and hurried but you must proceed as slowly and patiently as humanly possible, so start now as you mean to go on. This is a marathon, not a sprint.\r\n",
